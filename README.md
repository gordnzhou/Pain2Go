# Pain2Go

### Inspiration
Every 1 in 5 Canadians live with the pains of arthritis, and approximately 1.7 billion people around the world live in muscular and skeletal pain. Maybe it’s your family, your neighbors, or various stiffness felt in the mornings.

### What it does
To increase the accessibility to mobility and strength exercises for all ages, Pain2Go showcases a human muscular model with basic areas of focus. Clicking in to these common areas will provide a selection of exercises, scalable to different difficulties to improve accessibility for everyone.

### How we built it
Using vanilla JavaScript and a frequented Figma board, we spent the 24 hours with the goal of creating an intuitive resource for others, while learning in the process.

### Challenges we ran into
There were several merge conflicts and major decisions to make. As beginners, we raced against time balancing tutorials, debugging and problem-solving. Whether it was creating a navigation bar, overlaying images, or creating interactive elements, we made it through.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The main function of our project was achieved! We’re also proud to see the style come together.

### What we learned
Learning online and from each other, we took steps (and leaps) forward with our collective programming, design and collaboration knowledge.

### What's next for Pain2Go
Create a mobile app to increase accessibility
Add a survey asking about pains, equipment, previous history of injury to create a personalized workout plans (paid; consulting)
